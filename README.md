# DerivativeCalculator
Sinple calculator ithat takes in a function of x, and outputs its derivative using only the power rule.

Limitations:
- Can take in multiple variables, but doesn't take them into account. (Product rule not used)

- Doesn't support division or multiplication, or changing order of operations with parentheses.

- No simplification is performed; strictly power rule
